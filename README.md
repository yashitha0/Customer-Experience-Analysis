# Project Overview

The project involves a dataset that contains information about the inbound calls received by a company named ABC, which operates in the insurance sector. Our task is to use this data to answer the following questions:

## Data Analytics Tasks

1. **Average Call Duration**: Determine the average duration of all incoming calls received by agents. This should be calculated for each time bucket.  
   **Task**: What is the average duration of calls for each time bucket?

2. **Call Volume Analysis**: Visualize the total number of calls received.  
   **Task**: Can you create a chart or graph that shows the number of calls received in each time bucket?

3. **Manpower Planning**: The current rate of abandoned calls is approximately 30%. Propose a plan for manpower allocation during each time bucket (from 9 am to 9 pm) to reduce the abandon rate to 10%.  
   **Task**: What is the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to reduce the abandon rate to 10%?

4. **Night Shift Manpower Planning**: Customers also call ABC Insurance Company at night but donâ€™t get an answer because there are no agents available. This creates a poor customer experience. Assume that for every 100 calls that customers make between 9 am and 9 pm, they also make 30 calls at night between 9 pm and 9 am.  
   **Task**: Propose a manpower plan for each time bucket throughout the day, keeping the maximum abandon rate at 10%.

## Assumptions
- An agent works for 6 days a week.
- On average, each agent takes 4 unplanned leaves per month.
- An agent's total working hours are 9 hours, of which 1.5 hours are spent on lunch and breaks.
- On average, an agent spends 60% of their actual working hours (i.e., 60% of 7.5 hours) on calls with customers.
- The total number of days in a month is 30.
